                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Pakistan faces a significant energy crisis, largely due to its reliance on imported fossil fuels, which cover more than 30% of the country's energy needs. In response, the exploration of renewable energy sources has become critical, and wave energy, in particular, offers untapped potential along Pakistan's 1000 km coastline. Oscillating Water Columns (OWCs) are devices that harness this energy by using the movement of ocean waves to generate electricity. Our project focuses on designing and fabricating a functional OWC prototype to provide a sustainable energy solution.</p>

                <p>The image above shows the completed prototype of the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) system designed for this project. This prototype includes the key components such as the chamber, turbine, and water tank. By simulating wave motion, the prototype successfully demonstrates the functionality of converting wave energy into electrical energy.</p>
        
                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>The energy demand in Pakistan often exceeds supply, causing frequent power outages. With an extensive coastline, wave energy could generate up to 50,000 MW of electricity, particularly in coastal areas like Gwadar and Karachi. Adopting OWC technology could reduce Pakistan's dependency on fossil fuels, minimize global warming, and offer long-term economic benefits through job creation and sustainable energy generation.</p>
                
                <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimize Structural Design: Develop a sturdy and efficient OWC structure that maximizes wave energy capture.</li>
                    <li>Turbine Innovation: Create bi-directional turbine blades that convert wave-induced airflows into rotational energy efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Wave Generation System: Design a wave-generating mechanism to test the OWC under controlled, artificial wave conditions.</li>
                    <li>Water Tank Integration: Build a functional water tank to simulate wave action and test airflow dynamics within the OWC chamber.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The Gantt chart above outlines the timeline for the project's different phases, from initial research and design to prototype fabrication and testing. The chart shows how we managed our time efficiently across tasks like literature review, CAD modeling, and conducting simulations using ANSYS Fluent.</p>
        
                <h3>Design Overview</h3>
                <p>The OWC consists of a partially submerged chamber with an opening below the waterline. As waves oscillate, the water inside the chamber rises and falls, pushing air through a turbine connected to a generator. The design involves a cylindrical tube to channel airflow efficiently, with a turbine mechanism to convert air movement into electrical energy.</p>

                <p>This image shows the 3D CAD model of the turbine designed for the OWC system. The turbine is equipped with bi-directional blades that harness the airflow generated by oscillating water. The symmetrical blade design ensures unidirectional rotation regardless of the direction of airflow, improving energy conversion efficiency.</p>
        
                <h4>Software Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>SolidWorks: For 3D modeling the turbine, water column, and wave generator.</li>
                    <li>ANSYS Fluent: To analyze airflow and fluid dynamics.</li>
                    <li>MATLAB: For wave energy and efficiency calculations.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Fabrication Process</h3>
                <p>Our team built a prototype using 3D-printed parts for the turbine and stator components. The OWC chamber was developed based on precise measurements, considering factors such as water depth and wave heights. We utilized local resources and materials to minimize costs, demonstrating that the technology is scalable and affordable within Pakistan.</p>
        
                <h4>Testing</h4>
                <p>Using a custom-built water tank and wave generator, we conducted tests on the prototype at different wave angles (40° and 50°) and velocities. The results indicated that the OWC system is capable of producing energy under varying wave conditions, with promising implications for large-scale implementation.</p>
        
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The successful development of our OWC prototype highlights the potential for renewable energy from wave power in Pakistan. This technology offers an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels, reducing carbon emissions and fostering energy independence. The use of locally available materials and resources for the project demonstrates that OWC technology is a viable solution for Pakistan's energy challenges.</p>
